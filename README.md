# Dungeons and Dragons 101

A tool to handle a DnD session easily, in ruby;

## What is the idea

Provide all the steps for a DnD session smoothly so any person who wishes to do a small session, is able to start from here.

## 1. Setting up a game

Wizards (DnD owner) provides small stories for short adventures, so when starting the person selected to be the Dungeon Master can run a command that might return a random adventure.

```
dnd story
```

## 2. Heroes

All players might pick a [race](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Index:Races) and a [class](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Index:Classes). After their decision, they might be able to run a comand to get a pre filled sheet, by running:

```
dnd character <race> <class>
```

## 3. Keeping track of adventure

Also, when there is combat, the track might be controlable by the DM, which our tool also provides.

```
dnd combat 
```
